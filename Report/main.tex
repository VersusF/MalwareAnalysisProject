	\section{Executive summary}
	The malware ``Sample2.exe'' shows itself as a calculator app, with the appropriate icon and the expected behavior. Once it is opened by the user there is a simple GUI to perform simple arithmetic operations. Under the hood, however, the malware deactivates the Windows security center, makes many POST request to various internet sites and infect many other files in different locations, from the local folder to the system application's executable.
